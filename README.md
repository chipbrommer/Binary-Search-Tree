# Binary-Search-Tree

Created for USM Computer Science CSC 413. 

This program was created for use of academic purposes. Feel free to use as desired but please give credit. 

This is a basic C++ program to perform all necessary functions for a binary search tree. At start, the user has the option to enter an desired tree, select a tree from a pre-made list, or randomly generate a tree. The user can then choose from a menu all of the different functions to run against the tree: In-Order Traversal, Find the Minimum, Find the Maximum, Search for a particular key, Find the Predecessor, Find the Successor, Insert a value, and delete a value. The console prints to a convenient txt file for the user to use as desired. 

This program is not complete. I still need to implement clearing of the input line before accepting an input. And may take this program further for future details.
